Character encoding techniques are methods used to represent text in computers and other devices. Here are some of the most common techniques:

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):
    Uses 7 bits to represent 128 characters, including English letters, digits, and control characters.
    Extended ASCII uses 8 bits to include additional characters.

UTF-8:
    A variable-length encoding that can use 1 to 4 bytes for each character.
    Compatible with ASCII for the first 128 characters but can represent all Unicode characters, making it widely used on the web.

UTF-16:
    Uses 2 or 4 bytes per character.
    Commonly used in environments like Windows and Java.
